# Germ_cell_tumor_classification

Germ cell tumors are classified into two broad groups: seminoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT). <br>

The NSGCT is then divided further according to histology: <br>

* seminoma
* non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT)
* embryonal cell carcinoma
* choriocarcinoma 
* yolk sac tumor
* teratoma 
* mixed germ cell tumor

This project aims at training a deep learning classifier to predict the histopathology of lymph nodes around the testicles. We have abdominal CT-Scans coming from 19 institutes and annotations (contours) of the lesions done by a specialist.


# Bio Markers

This Deep Learning study can be further taken by combining biomarkers and deep learning diagnosis

- *Alpha-fetoprotein* (also called: aFP, AFP, alpha-fetoglobulin). Normal range: Adults: < 15 ng/ml.
A serum test used as a tumor marker for teratocarcinoma or embryonal carcinoma of the testis. Elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels are not found in other histologies of testicular cancer, although they may be found in patients with hepatocellular cancer. 

- *Beta Subunit HCG* (also called: human chorionic gonadotropin,β-HCG, beta-HCG, beta chain HCG.): Normal range: 0 ng/ml
A serum test used as a tumor marker for testicular carcinoma. Beta-HCG levels are never found in normal men. When the presence of β-HCG is detected in serum it always indicates a malignancy. 



**Note:** 
- Alpha-fetoprotein
Alpha-fetoprotein is also used as a marker postoperatively to monitor residual tumor.
Beta-HCG is also used as a marker postoperatively to monitor residual tumor and the effectiveness of therapy. 

- Beta-HCG
In patients with testicular cancer who underwent an orchiectomy, the presence of beta-HCG will confirm the presence of residual cancer and the need for a further treatment. Be careful, the absence of beta-HCG in the serum does not rule out the presence of an active cancer.
