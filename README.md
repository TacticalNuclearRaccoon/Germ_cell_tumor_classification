# Germ_cell_tumor_classification

Germ cell tumors are classified into two broad groups: seminoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT). <br>

The NSGCT is then divided further according to histology: <br>

* seminoma
* non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT)
* embryonal cell carcinoma
* choriocarcinoma 
* yolk sac tumor
* teratoma 
* mixed germ cell tumor

This project aims at training a deep learning classifier to predict the histopathology of lymph nodes around the testicles. We have abdominal CT-Scans coming from 19 institutes and annotations (contours) of the lesions done by a specialist.
